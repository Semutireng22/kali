# KaleidoFinance Auto Bot Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install and run the KaleidoFinance Auto Bot on a VPS.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that:
1. You have access to a VPS with a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. You have `wget` or `curl` installed on your VPS.
3. You have `sudo` privileges on the VPS.

## Installation Steps

#### Using `wget`:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Semutireng22/kali/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Using `curl`:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Semutireng22/kali/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable
Make the `install.sh` script executable:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Installation Script
Execute the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

### Step 5: Access the Bot Session (Optional)
If you want to monitor or interact with the bot, you can attach to the `screen` session:
```bash
screen -rd kaleidos
```

To detach from the session without stopping the bot, press `CTRL+A+D`

### Step 6: Restart the Bot (If Needed)
If the bot stops or you restart your VPS, you can restart it by running:
```bash
cd KaleidoFinance-Auto-Bot
screen -dmS kaleidos bash -c "npm run start"
```

## Notes

- **EVM Address**: Ensure that you enter a valid public EVM address when prompted. This address will be saved in the `wallets.txt` file.
- **Screen Session**: The bot runs in a detached `screen` session named `kaleidos`. You can always reattach to it using `screen -rd kaleidos`.
- **Logs**: If you encounter issues, check the logs generated by the bot for debugging.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Script Fails to Run**:
   - Ensure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x install.sh`.
   - Check if all required dependencies are installed.

2. **Bot Not Running**:
   - Verify that the `screen` session is active: `screen -ls`.
   - Reattach to the session: `screen -rd kaleidos`.

3. **Dependency Issues**:
   - If `npm install` fails, ensure that `nodejs` and `npm` are properly installed. You may need to install a specific version of Node.js.
